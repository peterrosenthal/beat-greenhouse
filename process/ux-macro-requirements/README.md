| Sequence/Object Name | Brief Description of Events | Location (Space and/or Time) | Player Mechanics | Player Goal | Design Goal | Assets Needed | Anticipated Stage of Development |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loading screen | Logos and a loading bar are presented as assets are loaded and Majenta MVAE checkpoints are connected to. | Takes up the whole screen, is the very first sequence encountered upon loading the page. | None | None | Present the user with something to look at so they know the experience is loading and not just frozen. Also an opportunity to advertize myself and ATLAS. | ATLAS logo, personal logo, and a logo for the game itself. | Mid-early development |
| (Optional/Beyond MVP) Log in with account | Player has a button to log into an account which will take them to a simple "connect with Google account" popup because I would do this the easy way with firebase. Player also has a button to simply continue as guest and play the game without logging in. | Takes up the whole screen, shows up immediately after completion of the loading screen. | Click on a UI button | Access saved plants | Allow the player to keep playing the game accross multiple sessions. | Possibly button design, possibly some logos. | Super late/optional development |
| Skip/Show tutorial | If the player choses to play as guest (which will be the only option if I don't get the time to implement accounts), or it's the first time their account is playing the game, then they will be presented with an option to be shown the tutorial or not. | A small pop-up window that takes up a small-ish portion of the center of the screen (the rest of the game is blurred out and/or darkened in the background). Pops up first thing after the player has started the game. | Click on a UI button | Choose between showing or skipping the tutorial. | The button gives the player the chance to skip right into playing the game. The existence of the tutorial itself gives me the designer a chance to educate the player on how to play the game. | None | Late development |
